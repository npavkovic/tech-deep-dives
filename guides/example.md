## Introduction

This is an example guide showing how your content will be displayed.

## Main Section

Your content from the `-edited.md` files goes here. All your existing markdown formatting will work:

- Lists work
- Code blocks work
- Everything renders properly

### Code Example

```javascript
function example() {
  return "This is how code looks";
}
```

## Next Steps

The audio player will appear at the top of each guide, using the MP3 you generate from NotebookLM.
