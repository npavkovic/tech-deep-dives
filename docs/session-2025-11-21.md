# Session Log: 2025-11-21

## Context
Continued work on Tech Deep Dives publication site after previous session where we:
- Built 11ty static site with homepage, guide pages, and podcast feed
- Implemented semantic tagging (`<deck>`, `<tldr>`, `${toc}`)
- Converted all guides to JSON frontmatter
- Renamed guide files to simple names (e.g., `kafka.md`, `redis.md`)
- Agent processed all 18 guides to add semantic tags

## Work Completed

### 1. Deck Description Extraction
**Problem**: Guide frontmatter still contained long auto-generated descriptions instead of the concise 2-sentence `<deck>` content.

**Solution**:
- Created `scripts/update-descriptions-from-deck.py` to extract `<deck>` content from markdown
- Script parses JSON frontmatter, finds `<deck>` tags in content, updates description field
- Processed all 18 guides successfully

**Result**: Homepage and podcast feed now show punchy 2-sentence summaries instead of long descriptions.

**Example**:
- Old: "Before Redis, the computing world operated under a rigid assumption: you could have either speed or durability, but not both..." (200+ words)
- New: "Redis bridged the gap between slow databases and fragile caches by treating RAM as first-class storage. What took milliseconds on disk now takes microseconds in memory—if you understand its five data structures."

### 2. Podcast Feed Descriptions
**Question**: Can we use deck descriptions for podcast episode descriptions?

**Answer**: Yes, already implemented. The podcast feed template (`feed.njk`) pulls from `guide.data.description`, so the updated deck descriptions automatically appear in the RSS feed.

### 3. Files Changed
- All 18 guide files in `guides/` - frontmatter descriptions updated
- Site rebuilt and deployed successfully

### 4. Git Activity
```
Commit: e314a4d - "Update frontmatter descriptions to use <deck> content"
- 18 files changed
- Pushed to main branch
```

## Current State

**Site Status**: ✅ Working
- Local dev server running at http://localhost:8080/
- Homepage displays 18 guides with deck descriptions
- Individual guide pages render correctly with TOC
- Podcast feed template ready (no episodes yet - no audio files uploaded)

**Content Quality**: ⚠️ Needs Review
User identified that guide structure needs another review pass. Deferred for future session.

## Next Steps (Future Sessions)

1. **Content Structure Review**: Review guide narrative structure and flow
2. **Audio Integration**: Add audio files and populate `audio` field in frontmatter
3. **Podcast Feed Testing**: Verify RSS feed works in podcast apps once audio is added
4. **Design Refinement**: Potential CSS adjustments based on reading experience
